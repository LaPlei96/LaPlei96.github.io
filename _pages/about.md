I am currently working as a PhD Student at CISPA in the group of Prof. Zeller.
My research focuses on learning the effects of software changes to build an automated tool for debugging, fault localization and automated program repair across programming languages. 

I am also an Adjunct Lecturer at the University of Luxembourg, teaching in the Cyberus Master.

Previously I worked for four and a half years at the Luxembourg Tech School as a Tech Educator and Research Associate.

I received my Bachelor Degree with distinction from the University of Luxembourg in 2023 followed by my Master from the Saarland University in 2024.
